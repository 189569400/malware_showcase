# Malware Showcase

This repository contains explanatory examples of malicious behavior like _file infection_ or _remote code execution_. It's supposed to demonstrate and explain 
the nature of malicious software with practical examples in Python.

**Note:** _This repository contains examples of malicious files. It should be used for educational purposes only. Usage of files in this repository for any other purpose might cause you legal issues, even though the provided examples are very simple. It is advised to follow the instructions._

### Showcase structure

- **File infector** - This kind of malware infects other files. Common example of such behavior is _code injection_. Malicious code is injected into targeted files and might be later executed. This allows the file infectors to spread. The purpose of their payload might differ, from harmless to destructive behavior.
