# Malware Showcase

This repository contains explanatory examples of malicious behavior like _file infection_ or _remote code execution_. It's supposed to demonstrate and explain 
the nature of malicious software with practical examples in Python.

**Note:** _This repository contains examples of malicious files. It should be used for educational purposes only. Usage of files in this repository for any other purpose might cause you legal issues, even though the provided examples are very simple. It is advised to follow the instructions._

### Showcase structure

- **File infector** - This kind of malware infects other files. Common example of such behavior is _code injection_. Malicious code is injected into targeted files and might be later executed. This allows the file infectors to spread. The purpose of their payload might differ, from harmless to destructive behavior.

- **Trojan (trojan horse)** - This kind of malware tries to look like a legitimate software and the malicious activity is hidden from the victim. Common example of such behaviour is _spying on victims_. Trojans can be more precisely classified by a purpose of the malicious segment. They were named after the Greek story, in which the city of Troy has accepted a statue of wooden horse as a gift from their enemies, while the enemy soldiers were hidden inside.

- **Worm** - This kind of malware tries to spread on the network and does not need a host file to spread. Worms might contain malicious payload and execute commands on the compromised systems or just consume the network bandwidth to jam the communication.
